# SM-GSBR
Julia implementation of the Stable Manifold-Geometric stick breaking reconstruction (SM-GSBR) model [*],

Folder "Henon" contains software used for the the simulations of complete quadratic (Henon) maps.
Folder "Non-invertible" contains software used for the the simulations of 2-d quadratic noninvertible maps.
Folder "Generalized Henon" contains software used for the the simulations of Generalized (dual) Henon maps.

The algorithm works with Julia 0.6.4.
